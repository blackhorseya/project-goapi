## adapter

Great! You have designed a top-level folder called `adapter`, which represents the entry points for all applications.
This structure helps organize the code and makes the entry points of the applications more clear and identifiable.

Within the `adapter` folder, you can add different entry points based on the requirements of your applications. For
example, if your application has a web API and a command-line interface (CLI), you can create the following structure
within the `adapter` folder:

```
adapter/
├── api/
│   └── main.go
└── cli/
    └── main.go
```

In the `api` folder, you can place the code for handling web API requests and start the web server in the `main.go`
file.

In the `cli` folder, you can place the code for handling command-line operations and define the respective commands and
command-line options in the `main.go` file.

This structure helps to clearly separate different application entry points, organizes the code, and provides better
scalability. Please adjust this structure according to your specific needs to fit your project.
